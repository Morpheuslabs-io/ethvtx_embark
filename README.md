# Embark x ÎžVTX

This is an Embark template showcasing the features of `ethvtx`.

[`ethvtx`](https://github.com/Horyus/ethvtx) is an Ethereum-ready Dapp Redux store. It will manage all the data and interactions between your user and the Ethereum Blockchain and is perfectly suited for React Dapps.

### Versions

| `embark` | `ethvtx` | `web3` |
| :------: | :------: | :---:  |
| 4.1.1    | 2.0.6    | 1.2.1  |

**Notice**
Node version 10 must be used to start up successfully

### Run the app

```shell
embark run
```

Be sure to import the correct accounts into your Wallet Manager (Metamask, Mist) to be able to run the transactions.

`embark` will run the test chain, deploy the contracts, build and serve the application.

On the console (or terminal), a dashboard shows up. We can:
  - Type the command `token` to get the access token (that is auto copied into clipboard)
  - Go to the `Cockpit` UI at: http://localhost:55555/
  - Paste the access token to login
